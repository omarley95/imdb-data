# IMDb Datasets 

## Introduction

IMDb is the world's most popular online source of information for movies, tv, video games and several other formats of entertainment. Information including cast, release dates, trivia, reviews and ratings can all be accessed within seconds. I use the app almost everyday and have become familiar with the abundance of data that it holds, in addition to spotting patterns and nuances that exist on the site. Therefore, I have chosen to take a deeper look into the [IMDb data](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) to dig deeper into my observations and to understand more about the platform and its data.
